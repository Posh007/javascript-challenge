# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Introduction

WAKE UP SHEEPLE!  `ALIENS-R-REAL!
`Can we prove it using the eye-witness data?  The provided dataset  [UFO Sightings Data](StarterCode/static/js/data.js) will be manipulated using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js.

### UFO Level 1: Automating Table and Date Search 

* Used the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects to write a code that appends a table to web page and also adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. Table have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment.` 

* Date form was used in HTML document [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) and a JavaScript code was written that would listen for events and search through `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### UFO Level 2: Multiple Search Categories 

Upon the completion of all of Level 1 criteria, multiple `input` tags and dropdowns were created using JavaScript code, so that they can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
